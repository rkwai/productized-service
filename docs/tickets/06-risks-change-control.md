# Ticket: Risks & Change Control improvements

## Goal
Strengthen risk insight with scoring, clearer visual risk mapping, and escalation workflows.

## Scope
- Risk KPIs, charts, risk register, and change requests.
- Mitigation and approval workflows.

## Tasks
### Stream A — Insights & Metrics
- Add risk score (severity x likelihood) and aging KPI.
- Add “time-to-resolution” stat per risk category.
- Add escalation thresholds (age + severity).

### Stream B — Visuals & UX
- Replace charts with risk matrix and aging trend.
- Add filters for severity/status/type.
- Pin top risks and show next action.

### Stream C — Workflow & Actions
- Add “Create mitigation plan” and “Approve change” actions.
- Auto-escalate to Action Center based on thresholds.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Risks show score, age, and escalation status.
- Risk matrix and aging trend replace placeholders.
- Filters and pinned risks support triage.
- Mitigation and approval actions route to Action Center.
