# Ticket: Home / Executive Summary improvements

## Goal
Enhance the Executive Summary page with clearer portfolio health insights, upgraded visuals, and actionable workflow shortcuts.

## Scope
- KPIs, charts, and the "Accounts needing attention" table.
- Quick actions and filters tied to portfolio risk.

## Tasks
### Stream A — Insights & Metrics
- Define a weighted portfolio health formula and trend vs. previous period.
- Establish explicit thresholds for “at-risk milestones” and “renewal risk.”
- Add a KPI for pipeline risk exposure across top accounts.

### Stream B — Visuals & UX
- Replace chart placeholders with a risk-vs-value scatter and health trend line.
- Add alert badges to the “Accounts needing attention” table.
- Improve KPI layout hierarchy with thematic grouping.

### Stream C — Workflow & Actions
- Add quick actions on key rows (e.g., “Open exec brief,” “Start escalation”).
- Add a “Top 10 at-risk” filter chip in the header.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Portfolio health definition and thresholds are documented in-page or via tooltip/help.
- Charts are populated with real visuals (no placeholders).
- Table rows show alert badges and provide quick actions.
- Quick filter chip works and updates the table.
