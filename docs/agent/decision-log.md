# Decision Log

## 2026-02-03 — Add executive value brief to Home
- Decision: Added an auto-generated Executive Value Brief card on the Home / Executive Summary page.
- Alternatives considered: Keep KPIs only; add a separate marketing-only landing page.
- Rationale: Execs need a concise narrative tying ROI, renewal exposure, and delivery risk together.
- Implications: The brief must stay aligned with KPI calculations and may warrant instrumentation/export later.
- Follow-ups: Consider copy/export and usage tracking for the brief.
