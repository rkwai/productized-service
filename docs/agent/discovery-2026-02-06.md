# Discovery Summary - 2026-02-06

## Scope
- Interviews A-C completed with 1 owner (solo AI product dev enablement).
- Interview D (local-only acceptability) deferred.

## Participant snapshot
- Business: 1-person AI product dev enablement
- Current tool: Excel
- Decision cadence: Ad-hoc

## Findings
### A) Baseline time-to-decision
- Baseline time: ~5 minutes from opening Excel to deciding focus.
- Blocking factor: Low volume; not enough clients to define a meaningful segment.
- Implication: Value threshold met (>= 5 min), but segmentation is currently underpowered.

### B) Trust in recommendations
- Would act on recommendation when next step is clear.
- Needs context on prior communications to act quickly.
- Would ignore if recommendation is vague or lacks rationale.
- Preferred cadence: Daily digest.

### C) Data coverage feasibility
- CAC, gross margin %, and LTV estimate tracked in Excel.
- Activation status not tracked today.
- Effort to fill missing data: < 5 minutes per lead.
- Expectation: Log actions once and have useful parts updated automatically.

## Threshold evaluation (from discovery plan)
- T2 baseline time: Proceed (>= 5 minutes).
- T1 trust: Inconclusive (1/1 says yes, but requires comm context).
- T3 data coverage: Inconclusive (partial coverage; activation missing).
- T4 acceptability: Not run.

## Decisions
- Proceed with value hypothesis pending more interviews.
- Iterate on recommendation UX to surface comm context.
- Define minimum viable data set that avoids activation-status dependency for now.

## Risks and unknowns
- Low volume limits segment reliability early on.
- Trust depends on comm history being visible at point of action.
- Local-only acceptability still unvalidated.

## Next steps
- Run Interviews A-C with 4 more owners.
- Optional: Run Interview D if local-only viability becomes a blocker.
- Convert findings into UX requirements and prototype changes.
